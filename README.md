This repository contains completed tasks assigned as part of my AI/ML internship program. Each task focuses on real-world applications of data science, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
Objective: Understand basic data exploration and visualization techniques.
Dataset: Iris dataset (loaded via Seaborn / CSV).
What I Did:
Loaded and inspected the dataset (.head(), .info(), .describe()).
Created scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to explore data distributions and detect outliers.
Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Outcome: Developed basic EDA skills and learned how to visualize relationships between features.
Task 2: Heart Disease Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease using classification models.
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (from Kaggle).
Model Used: Logistic Regression (optional: Decision Tree).
What I Did:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded features).
Performed EDA to analyze feature correlations.
Trained and evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
Identified the most important features influencing heart disease.
Key Results:
Achieved classification accuracy around XX% (you can update based on your results).
Key risk indicators: cholesterol level, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate.
Task 3: House Price Prediction
Objective: Predict house prices based on size, bedrooms, and location.
Dataset: House Sales in King County, USA (from Kaggle).
Model Used: Linear Regression (optionally: Gradient Boosting).
What I Did:
Preprocessed features: one-hot encoding for location, feature scaling.
Trained regression model and evaluated using MAE and RMSE.
Visualized actual vs. predicted prices with a scatter plot.
Key Results:
MAE: XX, RMSE: XX (replace with your values).
Sqft living and location had the most impact on predicted price.
